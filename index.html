      <p>
        John is looking for a quicker way to order materials to be delivered 
        to his job site and thinks that a web order may be just the thing.
        However, John has worked in construction his whole life and like many
        in that industry, has no technical/computer skills.
        John needs clear text and links around a home page to help him navigate the site.
